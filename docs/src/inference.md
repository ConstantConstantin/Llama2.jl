# Inference

## Prequisites

A model checkpoint is required. You can use your own or e.g. get the example file provided by karpathy:

```
wget https://huggingface.co/karpathy/tinyllamas/resolve/main/stories15M.bin
```

## Inferencing

You can either generate a single text, optionally giving an input prompt, or have an interactive chat (TODO).
